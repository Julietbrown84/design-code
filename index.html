        <h2> SUMMARY:</h2>
       <h5> 
        I am a driven, and honest Junior Developer with a
        previous art/design background, recently having put over one thousand hours into development training through Enspiral Dev Academy and with also four years of fine art/design training from the University of 
        Auckland - ELAM, Bachelor of Fine Arts.</br>

        I enjoy both leading and working within teams, as well as alone. 
        Having the ability and understanding to both design and building products really excites me. Technology is the way of the future, my passion is visually creating meaning that 
        interacts and connects emotionally with  people.</br>

        I enjoy being curious and pushing the boundaries with
        technology and design there are endless possibilitites, but I also having an empathetic approach to problems. I often use empathy to explore the "why" and solve the "how".
        I love the continous advances in technology it creates better
        ways to solving problems for the community.</br>

        I am really excited about my technology career and contributing to society as a woman. Extending my programming and art/design skill sets through learning is a high priority in order to deliver a superior quality of work and to continue to progress in both fields.</br>
        Right now, I am immersing myself with rebuilding a 
        personal website, learning gulp and starting a group application.
        project.

        <h2> WORK EXPEREINCE: </h2>
        <h7>Junior Developer (Enspiral Dev Academy) - 2015 - Awarded Diverstity Scholarship</h7></br>
       <h5>

        Enspiral Dev Academy is a pratical bootcamp style computer programming course where over one thousand hours
        is spent learning skills in Ruby and Rails,
        Javascript and Jquery, Agile, HTML5 and CSS, Git, and TDD.</br>
        Engineering Empathy are the key focus areas for soft skills and help to integrate workers into a realistic working environment, learning how to work in teams in a commercial high pressure enviroment and deal with issues that might arise when working with others.</br>
        The course has a large emphasise on learning through doing. We pair from day one and every week we are finishine the week with a tem project.
        Over the 18 weeks we build basic terminal apps, to full stack apps with web frame works such as rails.</br>
       This project called "Inkling" - A mind map ap for creative ideas, was an exploration project where art meets code.
       I really felt passionate about this project It was a great unique learning expereince. Where I really applied and immersed myself in the unknown of creativity and technolodgy. It was a learning expereince that mentally challenged and pushed me through designing, programming,  team work, and  a final presentation.</br>
       I particallry worked closely with another team member with the front end development we had a quirky approach to the app. I also disovered a new  found hobbie three.js which I quickly taught myself in this last week of the project.

      <h7>
       DNA Design - Auckland
      Work Expereince September 2014 - November 2014</h7></br>
      <h5>
      I Worked on the UIUX team with the re-design of the BNZ ATM machine to gather information from the client and problem slving the design. </br>
      DNA has an unique approach to design, user expereince, empathy and problem solving this provided me with a valuable insight into
       Customer Experience Design.</br>
      Emphasis was placed around the customers empathy and needs in relation to the most efficient business model. 
      We looked closely at the customers and how the product was to meet the client needs. We then mocked up some options and started to take users through design testing.</br>
       I was exposed to the psychology behind developing in a customer driven design method.This gave me great insights to design and the power of software.
      It really excited me to transfer my studies which led me into the curiosity of softare development.

      <h5>
      Most of this work was stakeholder management. Building a close relationship with a portfolio of clients and being able to work out solution on their overdue accounts. My ability to negotiate and empathise was paramount as was my ability to work efficiently to hit deadlines.</br>
      This was a very highly measured, customer focussed and target
      driven enviroment provided clear visibility of performance
      and how to improve.</br>
      Required detailed knowledge of finances, and understanding of company and customer needs to ensure targets were met of debt.</br>
      I consistently met targets and often exceeded expectations in relation to personal effort required. Often worked longer hours to ensure that all tasks were completed.

      <h5>
      As a Community Centre Leader, I facilitated
      "Creative Learning Scheme’s" for Alternative Education. Students who have been disengaged from education for a variety of reasons who now had the opportunity to flourish, develop confidence and grow in a smaller learning environment. I budgeted, planned and coordinated programs and activities to ensure that the children’s needs were met effectively.
      I formed strong relationships and made a difference to these challenging students which lead them back positively to the high school education system. I always needed to maintain a clear thinking approach, strong decision making skills ,
      creative and analytical outlook.
