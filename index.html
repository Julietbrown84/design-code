    <h2> SUMMARY:</h2>
     <h5> 
        I am a driven, and passionate Junior Web Developer with a
        previous art/design background. I recently put over one thousand hours into development training through Enspiral Dev Academy.</br>

        I enjoy both leading and working within teams, as well as alone. 
        Having the experience to both design and building products really excites me. Technology is the way of the future, my passion is visually creating meaning that 
        interacts and connects emotionally with  people.</br>

        I enjoy being curious and pushing the boundaries with
        technology and design these are endless possibilities, but I also have an empathetic approach to problems.</br>
        I often use empathy to explore the "why" and solve the "how".
        I love the continous advances in technology it creates better
        ways to solving problems for the community.</br>

        I am really excited about my technology career and contributing to society as a woman.
        Right now, I am rebuilding a personal website, learning gulp and starting a group app
        project.

      <h5>
      During University I worked part time and full time during the holidays. I was responsible for up to 4 staff members and 30+ children in a busy enviroment.</br>
      My roll became diverse when I was Identitfied with being a team player, innovative, personable and self motivated.</br>
      As one of the managers I was required to design the pro- grammes structure. I implemented and facilatated new ideas and further developed positive relationships with children and parents.This lead to the programmes growth from 10 to 40 + children in the holidays.

      <h5>
      Most of the work was stakeholder management. Building a close relationship with a portfolio of clients and being able to work out solution on their overdue accounts.</br>
      My ability to negotiate and empathise was paramount as was my ability to work efficiently to hit deadlines.
      This was highly measured, customer focussed and target driven enviroment which provided clear visibility of performance and how to improve.<br>
      Required detailed knowledge of finances, and understanding of company and customer needs to ensure targets were met of debt.</br>
      I consistently met targets and often exceeded expectations in relation to personal effort required. Often working longer hours to ensure that all tasks were completed.

    (University of Auckland- ELAM) - 2010 - 2014</h7></br></a>
    <h5>
    This Degree focused on pushing the boundries on a creative an conceptual level. The final honours year students must research and explore a particular topic and present a thesis with a final presentation in any visual form.</br>
    For me, this was an individualised in-depth theoretical exploration of the self, fine arts, philosophy and design. Please see link to portfolio below.</br>
    Out of 80 students Elam purchased one of my artworks for their private collection now displayed in the University of Auckland.

      (Enspiral Dev Academy) - 2015 </br>
      Awarded Diverstity Scholarship</h7></br></a>
     <h5>
      Enspiral Dev Academy is a pratical bootcamp style web developing course where over one thousand hours
      is spent learning skills in Ruby and Rails, Javascript, Jquery, Agile, HTML5,CSS3, Git, and TDD.</br>
      Engineering Empathy is the key focus area for soft skills and to help integrate workers into a realistic working environment, this is learning how to work in teams in a commercial high pressure enviroment and deal with issues that might arise when working with others.</br>
      The course has a large emphasise on learning through doing. We pair from day one and every week we finish the week with a team project.
      Over the 18 weeks I built basic terminal apps, to full stack with web frame works such as rails.</br>
      The final project was called "Inkling" - A mind map app for creative ideas, this was an exploration project where art meets code.
      I really felt passionate about this project where I really immersed myself in the unknown of  creativity and technology. It was a learning expereince that mentally challenged and pushed me through designing, programming,  team work, and  a final presentation.</br>
      I also disovered a new  found hobbie three.js which I quickly taught myself in this last week of the project.

     DNA Design - Designing Customer Experience Auckland
    Work Expereince September 2014 - November 2014</h7></br></a>
    <h5>
     I Worked on the UIUX team with the re-design of the BNZ ATM machine to gather information from the clients to help re evaluate the design. </br>
     Emphasis was placed around the customers empathy and needs in relation to the most efficient business model. 
     We looked closely at the customers and how the product was to meet the client needs. We then mocked up some options and started to take users through design testing.</br>
     I was exposed to the psychology behind developing a customer driven design method. This gave me great insights to design and the power of software.</br>
     This really excited me, which made me really curious and wanting to learn more seeing technology really connecting with people in many meaningful ways

    <h5>
    As a Community Centre Leader, I facilitated "Creative Learning Scheme's" for Alternative Education. Students who have been disengaged from education for a variety of reasons who now had the opportunity to flourish, develop confidence and grow in a smaller learning environment.</br>
    I budgeted, planned and coordinated programs and activities to ensure that the children's needs were met effectively.
    I formed strong relationships and made a difference to these challenging students which lead them back positively to the high school education system.</br>
    I always needed to maintain a clear thinking approach, strong decision making skills ,
    creative and an analytical outlook.
