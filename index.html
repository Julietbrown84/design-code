        <h2> SUMMARY:</h2>
       <h5> 
        I am a driven, and honest Junior Developer with a
        previous art/design background, recently having put over one thousand hours into development training through Enspiral Dev Academy and with also four years of fine art/design training from the University of 
        Auckland - ELAM, Bachelor of Fine Arts. 

        I enjoy both leading and working within teams, as well as alone. 
        Having the ability and understanding to both design and building products really excites me. Technology is the way of the future, my passion is visually creating meaning that 
        interacts and connects emotionally with  people . 

        I enjoy being curious and pushing the boundaries with
        technology and design there are endless possibilitites., but I also having an empathetic approach to problems. I often use empathy to explore the “why” and solve the “how”.
        I love the continous advances in technology it creates better
        ways to solving problems for the community.

        I am really excited about my tech career and contributing to society as a woman. Extending my programming and art/
        design skill sets through learning is a high priority in order to deliver a superior quality of work and to continue to progress in both fields. Right now, I am working on rebuilding a 
        personal website, learning gulp and starting a group ap
        project.

       <h5>
        Enspiral Dev Academy is a pratical bootcamp style computer 
        is spent learning programming skills Engineering Empathy.a

        Engineering Empathy are the key focus 
        areas for soft skills and to help integrate students into a 
        realistic working environment, learning how to work in teams in a commercial high pressure enviroment and deal with issues that might arise when working with others.

        The course has a large emphasise on learning through doing. This takes place over an eighteen week period.

        I took myself from pairing and building basic terminal apps, to working with web frame works such as rails, and callaborating in a final one week project . This project called“Inkling” - a mind map ap for creative ideas, was an exploration project where art meets code.
         I really felt passionate about this project It was a great unique learning expereince. Where I really applied and immersed myself in the unknown of creativity and technolodgy. It was a learning expereince that mentally challenged and pushed me through designing, programming,  team work, and  a final 
        presentation.
        I particallry worked closely with another team member with the front end development we had a quirky approach to the ap. I also disovered a new  found hobbie three.js which I quickly taught myself in this last week of the project.

        Universitiy of Auckland Bachelor of Fine Arts (honours) degree focused on creative and conceptual thinking. The final Honours year students must research and explore a particular topic and present a
        thesis wth a final presentation in any visual material. For me , it was an individualised in-depth theoretical exploration of self/ Fine arts/Philosophy/ and Design, which I developed my ideas and expressions through a range of visual tools.

        and how to improve.
        Required detailed knowledge of finances, and understanding of company and customer needs to ensure targets were met of debt.

        Alternative Educaion Facilatator - Jan 2007 - July
        2011
        As a Community Centre Leader, I facilitated
        “Creative Learning Scheme’s” for Alternative Education. Students who have been disengaged from education for a variety of reasons who now had the opportunity to flourish, develop confidence and grow in a smaller learning environment. I budgeted, planned and coordinated programs and activities to ensure that the children’s needs were met effectively.
        I formed strong relationships and made a difference to these challenging students which lead them back positively to the high school education system. I always needed to maintain a clear thinking approach, strong decision making skills ,
        creative and analytical outlook.
